App Navigation
--------------

The template uses the View-Model-First pattern to implement navigation between pages. You should follow a naming convention to allow the app to automatically create 
a view based on a view model. For example, if your app contains a view model named MainViewModel, you should name the corresponding page MainPage (the Page suffix 
should replace the ViewModel suffix). See the following topic for more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/enterprise-application-patterns/navigation
